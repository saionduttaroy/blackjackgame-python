**The object of this game is to win money by creating card totals higher than those of the dealer's hand but not exceeding 21, or by stopping at a total in the hope that dealer will bust.**

Rules:

 - *The player can stand or hit.*
 - *The player can pick their betting amount.*
 - *If the total exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it immediately lose.*
